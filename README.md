# Learn Python 3

A programming language can best be learned by practicing it.

## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of materials for teaching/learning Python 3 (3.5+).

#### Requirements
* Have Python 3.5 or newer installed. You can check the version by typing `python3 --version` in your command line. You can download the latest Python version from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* Have [Jupyter Notebook installed](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).

If you can not access Python and/or Jupyter Notebook on your machine, you can still follow the web based materials. However, you should be able to use Jupyter Notebook in order to complete the exercises.

#### Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Run `jupyter notebook` command in your command line in the repository directory.
3. Jupyter Notebook session will open in the browser and you can start navigating through the materials.
