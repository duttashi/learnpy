#### Script Naming Convention

The following are the various types of python topics that I'll be writing about.

- machine learning abbreviated as `ml_`
- pandas abbreviated as `ml_pd_`
- class abbreviated as `cls_`
- dictionary abbreviated as `dict_`
- list abbreviated as `list_`
- series abbreviated as `series_`
- method abbreviated as `method_`
- web data scrapping abbreviated as `scraper_`

Therefore, as outlined above the script name will always begin with the type it represents. For example, if the script is related to pandas, then it'll be named as `ml_pd_exploring_data.py`

Furthermore, if the script contains code on more than 1 topic outlined above, then the topic that is central to the script will take precedence, in script naming. Example: suppose a script has an exploratory analysis of a dictionary based dataset, then the script will be named as `ml_*.py` *where * represents some meaningful script name*
